# percolation
A solution for the percolation problem of a Coursera course, with also a web demonstration

## The coursera course

This repository was an exercise of [this Coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1). The problem was about **percolation** and was to be solved with **Java**.

## The Java software

The Java software was written with **NetBeans** and solves **percolation** with a sort of **union find** algorithm.

## The website

The same algorithms was also translated in **javascript** to show a web demonstration of the percolation problem.
